# VLSI Projects

Welcome to my **VLSI Projects** repository!  
This collection showcases various digital design and verification projects that I’ve implemented using **Verilog HDL**. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my hands-on experience in RTL design, testbench creation, waveform analysis, and digital logic implementation using industry-relevant tools and methods.

## 🎓 About Me

I'm currently pursuing **M.Tech in VLSI Design** at **SRM Institute of Science and Technology**, Kattankulathur. I have completed my **B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE)**, and I’m passionate about building a strong foundation in digital design, simulation, and RTL verification through practical projects.
