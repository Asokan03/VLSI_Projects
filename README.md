# VLSI Projects

Welcome to my VLSI Projects repository!  
This collection showcases various digital design and verification projects that I’ve implemented using Verilog HDL. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my hands-on experience in RTL design, testbench creation, waveform analysis, and digital logic implementation using industry-relevant tools and methods.
